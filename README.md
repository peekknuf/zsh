Color scheme: One half dark <br>
ZSH theme: awesomepanda <br>
Font: MesloLGS NF (optional) <br>
BG image opacity: 10% <br>

Tweaks made to the original theme are the different color of the dir name, i hate cyan sry and it shows the whole path(i prefer it that way) instead of current dir only (which is kinda useless).

Powerlevel10k is overrated tho <br>
Final Look: <br>
